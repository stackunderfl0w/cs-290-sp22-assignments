		<h3>
			What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you work through them?
		</h3>
		<p>
			I had some trouble with github. I didn't want to set up a token so I tried for awhile to use github desktop but had an issue where it would not recognise I had signed in. I gave up and moved to sublime merge where I unfortunately ended up having to use a token anyways. Next time I'l just use the terminal.
		</p>
		<h3>
			 What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?
		</h3>
		<p>
			I learned how to use github classroom. I already knew how to use the engineering server web hosting, the html syntax and tags used.
		</p>
		<h3>
			 What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Campuswire forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?
		</h3>
		<p>
			I mostly used info from the class to finish the assignment. I also used a website called w3schools to help me with this assignment. I mostly just used it for code examples and syntax.

		<h3>
    		What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?
		</h3>
		<p>
			Most of the assignment was chalenging, if I had to pick one it would be lining up the twits to be the same height and apear in aligned columbs. I was trying to have the twit container float in the center while still having the twits float to the left but I could not get this working. I everntually looked closer at the mocks and noticed that the container just had a constant distance from the side.
		</p>
		<h3>
		    What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?
		</h3>
		<p>
			I learned how to use flex boxes and elements. I got a better handle on specificity, firefox's inspect element was amazing for that since it showed you where an element inherited its traits and what was overwritten. I knew very little of this ahead of time.
		</p>
		<h3>
		    What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Campuswire forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?
		</h3>
		<p>
			Reasources like the Mozilla developer network and the class code examples were the most useful. The mdn was very useful for learning the standards and the code from class gave good starting points for parts of the assignment.I also found out that I could use firefox's inspector to see soo much data about each element and where its traits originated. That especially was extremely helpful when debuging.
		</p>
		<h3>
		    What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?
		</h3>
		<p>
			I had to google flex boxes, box shadows, scaling, and so much more I can't even remember.

			What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?

		</h3>
		<p>
			Many things about this assignment were chalenging. First and formost I had never worked in javascript before, though thankfully the syntax is not too strange. I had a problem where I could not insert a new twit into the dom, I ended up solving this problem by reading the mdn documentation and asking a friend.
		</p>
		<h3>
		    What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?
		</h3>
		<p>
			I learned how to find elements from javascript, add elements to the dom, show and hide elements, and how to use regex from javascript.
		</p>
		<h3>
		    What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?
		</h3>
		<p>
			Google was very helpful for pointing me in the right direction. I mostly used stackoverflow for specific issues I had while programming and the mdn for getting info on what I was suppost to do.
		</p>
		<h3>

		<h3>
			What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?
		</h3>
		<p>
			I had some rather strage issues with using switch cases in javascript. Though that ended up being me not using the right commands for returning files. Beyond that my issues were just with parts of the assignment requirements being unclear.

    		What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?

		<p>
			I learned how to use node js and how to write a server with it.I aparently already had node.js on my computer as a dependency for some package.

		</h3>
		<p>
			The class code was extremely helpful, I was able to use that as a starting point that made the assignment rather straightforward. I used stackoverflow for a couple minor issues I had.
		</p>
		<h3>
    		What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?

		<p>
			I had to google how switch cases work in javascript and why it might not work with strings without aditional conversion.
