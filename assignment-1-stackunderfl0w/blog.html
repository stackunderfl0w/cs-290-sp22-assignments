		<h3>
			What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you work through them?
		</h3>
		<p>
			I had some trouble with github. I didn't want to set up a token so I tried for awhile to use github desktop but had an issue where it would not recognise I had signed in. I gave up and moved to sublime merge where I unfortunately ended up having to use a token anyways. Next time I'l just use the terminal.

		<h3>
			 What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?
		</h3>
		<p>
			I learned how to use github classroom. I already knew how to use the engineering server web hosting, the html syntax and tags used.
		</p>
		<h3>
			 What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Campuswire forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?
		</h3>
		<p>
			I mostly used info from the class to finish the assignment. I also used a website called w3schools to help me with this assignment. I mostly just used it for code examples and syntax.
